Today, the “commander house” sits under a glass case, as in itself a particularly precious exhibit. All camp commanders after 1941 inhabited the house, including the name indelibly linked to the camp, Albert konrad Gemmeker. After the war, the colonial history is linked to the house, through col. Van der Speck O’Breen, a former officer in the Dutch Army in Indonesia becoming territorial commander and assigned duties in relation to the temporary habitation of the Moluccans. Built by day wagers, many of them Jewish refugees, working to survive in Drenthe, the house is historically significant for the rights, exclusion and perception of refugees in the Netherlands and how the regime of detention for protection gradually turned into a space of concentration and the Holocaust. A symbol of power for most living in the nearby camp, before, during and after the war, it was a vehicle of a spatial organisation of power and  hierarchy by means of demarcations.  All through the existence of any form of camp, it spoke about a process of denationalization or statelessness for refugees, inmates and for the temporary inhabitants of Schattenberg. It was inevitably a space of power for the various individuals who lived in the camp. Inmates in the camp would refer to it as the “outside”(3) These connotations reinforced the oppositions which makes a camp: between “citizens” and “strangers”, “natives” and “migrants”, “residents” and “occupiers”. The story of the former “Commander’s” house tells us a lot about the physical existence designated who was an inmate and who held authority and how. What are the implications of memorialization when the most visible element on the site is the “the heritage” of authority and of the perpetrator?","start_date":"1939-01-01","end_date":"1939-01-01","year":"1939","latitude":52.9175,"longitude":6.6031944,"provenance":"The Westerbork Memorial","files":[{"id":742,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/742","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T09:20:39+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:24:13+00:00","filename":"2c01c5e0acc86a00093ae3762078f32e.jpg","authentication":"f0e47bc50d3b665b7a9f6ea1d2d397f0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 1_ Commander House_1939.jpg","size":53322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":463,"resolution_y":334,"compression_ratio":0.11493643382781}},"item":{"id":2099,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2099","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}},{"id":2100,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2100","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:20:40+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T16:49:17+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2100","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2100","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"The Westerbork movie","timeline_label":"Giving back a Roma story","description":"During spring 1944, Jewish deportee Rudolf Breslauer documented the everyday life in the Westerbork transit camp on film. The function of Westerbork was to assemble Romani and Dutch Jews for transport to Nazi concentration camps. The film was commissioned by the German camp commander Albert Gemmeker. Gemmeker meant to produce a professional film aimed at showing the economic value of the camp. Breslauer documented the Tuesday train transports to other concentration camps, though most images picture ‘moments of normalcy’; healthy men and women working in workshops, playing sports, children at school, or scenes at the hospital, cabaret and even a church service. The Westerbork Film was never completed, but much of the raw footage is preserved. Since 1948, fragments of the film are widely used in documentaries, films and newsreels. Footage of the transports, especially the scene of the Dutch Sinti girl Settela Steinbach who looks at us from behind the doors of a boxcar, became iconic for the systematic extermination programme of the Nazis. The film remains the only filmed documentation of a concentration camp during the war.","start_date":"1944-01-01","end_date":"1944-01-01","year":"1944","latitude":52.9168056,"longitude":6.6065833,"provenance":"The Westerbork footage","files":[{"id":759,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/759","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T16:49:17+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T16:49:17+00:00","filename":"694db60bada2efe128529df1226f1aca.mp4","authentication":"b1456643651e331b3cde76a836c77409","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"video/mp4","order":null,"original_filename":"hmwesterborkfilmtransport.mp4","size":10953961,"stored":true,"type_os":"ISO Media, MPEG v4 system, version 1","metadata":{"mime_type":"video/quicktime","audio":{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo","streams":[{"dataformat":"mp4","codec":"ISO/IEC 14496-3 AAC","sample_rate":44100,"channels":2,"bits_per_sample":16,"lossless":false,"channelmode":"stereo"}]},"video":{"dataformat":"quicktime","resolution_x":640,"resolution_y":480,"fourcc":"avc1","frame_rate":25},"comments":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]},"comments_html":{"language":["Undetermined"],"encoding_tool":["Lavf58.23.100"]}},"item":{"id":2100,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2100","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}},{"id":2101,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2101","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:20:41+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:23:42+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2101","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2101","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Report of the NIOD concerning the activities of the Friedrich Weinreb (original title:”Rapport door het Rijksinstituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie uitgebracht aan de Minister van Justitie inzake de activiteiten van drs. F. Weinreb), by D. Giltay Veth and A.J. van der Leeuw, 1976","timeline_label":"De-constructing heroism","description":"In 1973, the RIOD issued a report on the collaboration of Friederich Weinreb, a man of Jewish origin who had been both hailed for his brave actions during the war to save Jews and accused of de facto collaboration, The quest for moral grounds concerning collaborationa and resistance was not however a historigraphical debate. It is telling that RIOD, an institution which had concentrated the documentation on “occupation” of the Netherlands, to centre stage in the  political dispute between the left and the right in Dutch politics at the time. The case brought against Weinreb shows both a deep reconsideration of memory politics across time, the way the image of the resistance was embroiled with contemporary politics and the specific change in the way witnesses and the Holocaust became gradually a matter of social widespread guilt and regret, rather than individual trajectories and suffering.  Indeed, when Friedrich Weinreb decided to publish his memoirs in 1969, Collaboratie en verzet 1940-1945, he did so with the close collaboration of Renate Rubinstein and Aad Nuis, two journalists on the left side of the political spectrum. The war and resistance were a heroic narrative equally resonant to those who asked for more radical expressions in Dutch politics as a whole. Rubinstein’s weekly columns in Vrij Nederland, which started to appear in 1962 were a pertinent social commentary, widely read at the time.  In 1969, the fact that an influential journalist on the left was willing to support of a member of the Jewish community who had been previously been accused of collaboration is of significance in itself. The 1960s were a time of intense contestations in Dutch politics, with massive street movements directed against the government (provos) and where state establishment was being heavily questioned. The role of resistance, opposition, leftism and Jewish resistance were crucial in these debates about the political spectrum. Like in Germany, the memory of the war was central to the political debate, as many were contesting the credentials and the credibility of key indivisuals in administration and political parties. Their actions during the war were being scrutinized less for an interest in the conflict, but more so to establish a form of “moral highground”. These actions and the debate were symptomatic for a changing memory politics around the Second World War which was growingly turning to the global Holocaust remembrace discourse. In a Dutch history dominated by heroic images of resistance, there were many episodes which became candidates to be integrated in this memory canon but there was an increasing sensitivity to the narratives set in place immediately after the war. There was an interest, one might argue, in a functional history, one that could mediate of sorts the political sphere. The publication changed and influenced a particular type of the image of the collaboration.  With passages such as N/A, the impression was one of a man who reacted to circumstances, rather than care for strong political statements. Almost none of the opponents of Weinreb, whether they were Germans or Jews, were actually endowed with any privilege that might have been of interest to him. Consequently, yhe image he constructed was rather that of a disobedient rebel, also prone to tricking a highly organized SS in the Netherlands, a rather \"bourgeois disobedience of the rebel,\" of the man who stood alone in his struggle against the bureaucracy, which he often outwitted. Weireb’s selfstyled resistance and what is evidently a work of disculpation by placing blame on circumstances, government and others resonated with the deep fractures between left and right which were the main field of social and political debate in “Western” Europe in the 1960s.","start_date":"1976-01-01","end_date":"1976-01-01","year":"1976","latitude":52.9181944,"longitude":6.6093611,"provenance":"NIOD","files":[{"id":743,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/743","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/2c3b907101ec42d70797c06cf782f08e.jpg","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/2c3b907101ec42d70797c06cf782f08e.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/2c3b907101ec42d70797c06cf782f08e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/2c3b907101ec42d70797c06cf782f08e.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-09T09:20:42+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:23:42+00:00","filename":"2c3b907101ec42d70797c06cf782f08e.jpg","authentication":"f1190bfed890981b3343046676a659d6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"WBK_icon 4 Weinreb report_1976.jpg","size":10041,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, comment: \"CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJ\"","metadata":{"mime_type":"image/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":300,"resolution_y":418,"compression_ratio":0.026690590111643}},"item":{"id":2101,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2101","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}},{"id":2102,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2102","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:20:42+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:23:22+00:00","item_type":"icon","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2102","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=2102","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"A diary","timeline_label":"Recovering an eyewitness","description":"The diary of Etty Hillesum was only published in 1979, after long attempts by writer Klaas Smelik, who she entrusted with the manuscript.

By the beginning of the 1950ties the crematory was demolished. The leaders of the Moluccans living in Westerbork complained about the (state of the) building. Local former resistance fighters then offered to make the crematory into a monument. The Staatsbosbeheer, the national bureau that guards the woods (the grounds of the crematory were and are owned by them) objected to this. They didn’t not want a bulk of monuments (and people comming to see those monuments) on its ground. The central rabbinate in Amsterdam secondly said that the did not care about the future of the building and in their mind it could be destroyed. Last but not least, the Ministery of War – some young soldiers were trained in the surroundings of the crematory in this period – said it was not good for young soldiers tob e confronted with such a building. In the end the decission was made to destroy the building.  The debris was used in a part to pave and reinforce the road between the camp and the campfarm. It is interesting because its lack also contributess to the distinct image of Westerbork as a \"humane\" camp, in noticeable contrast to the quintessential images of the Nazi camps in Germany and Poland.
