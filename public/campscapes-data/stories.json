In an effort of the government to activate workers who because of the economic depression lost their jobs, a system of labour camps was developed. Illegal refugees were then no longer allowed to work in regular jobs. They were, however, offered comparable reclamation and agricultural work in a new, almost military organised, fenced refugee camps such as Heijplaat in Rotterdam. In addition, small groups of German Jewish refugees found work in a number of Zionist kibbutzim and hakhshara (agricultural) training centres as to prepare themselves for emigration to Palestine. When the war broke out, Zionist pioneer camps like the Deventer Association (1918) and, in particular, the modern agricultural school complex Werkdorp Wieringermeer (1934) each had some three hundred workers occupied.Wieringermeer under its last Jewish director Abel Herzberg was evacuated in 1941 by the Amsterdam SD. Most refugees were sent to the new Amsterdam ghetto, from where with the second razzia (raid) on 11 June the majority of Werkdorp Jews were deported first to Camp Schoorl and from there, just like the victims of the first Amsterdam raid of 22-23 February (which would lead to the February Strike), to Mauthausen (Austria) where most of them died within a few months after arrival.</p>\n<p>When the first occupants of Westerbork arrived, it brought a temporary respite in an otherwise precarious existence. Aanti-refugee sentiments were often stirred up on a local level by right-wing neighbours who did not like the idea of having foreigners in their countryside.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of the German occupation also Dutch Jews were treated on paper already as potential refugees. This proved to become practice after the beginning of the deportations in February 1941, when there was little distinction being made anymore between Jewish residents and “stateless” German-Jewish refugees. Both groups were from then on treated in the same way as internees of the same transit camp waiting to be deported to the eastern labour-, concentration or extermination camps, sometimes the one treated more brutal, or offered more privileges than the other.</p>\n<p>Jews were needed, on the one hand, for forced labour in the war industry, whereas on the other, war introduced more easy and violent ways to exclude the millions of Polish and Russian Jews in the newly occupied Eastern territories. It was to these regions that from mid 1942 also many Westerbork Jews were deported.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1906,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1906","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:16:06+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:16:06+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1906","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":139,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/139","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Those

However, it speaks more broadly about how the history of the rise of authoritarianism in Europe in the 1930s has been quietly erased from this history of camps and sites of political violence in Europe. Indeed, little of the precarious position of European Jewish refugees in 1938 in the Netherlands was of interest during the debate , although the neglect of this history has been an enduring staple of the discussions about accountability in the Netherlands in the last decades. It has subsided, however, exactly at a time when issues of responsibility would be relevant for the wider political and public sphere. In contrast to other camps, Westerbork was originally built as a Centraal-Jewish Refugee camp funded by the community, and because of the Nazi-German occupation changed in 1942 from a refugee camp for Jews into a transit camp. This background as a refugee camp supported the deceptive, humane façade of the following <em>Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager Westerbork</em>, which made it into one of the Third Reich’s most operational West-European gates to the hell of the Central and Eastern European Nazi-German concentration and extermination camps.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1870,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1870","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:14:09+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:14:09+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1870","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":131,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/131","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"The Jewish community financed Westerbork","description":"Report on the initial role of the Jewish community","startDate":"1983-12-16","provenance":"Nieuw Israëlietisch Weekblad","files":[{"id":570,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/570","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/4a6f456a44e6407f205f2d142dc205e9.jpg","fullsize":null,"thumbnail":null,"square_thumbnail":null},"added":"2019-08-09T08:14:11+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:14:12+00:00","filename":"4a6f456a44e6407f205f2d142dc205e9.jpg","authentication":"38ea34aee4ea0c67d1af43c207a99e03","has_derivative_image":false,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"3_1983-16-12 NIW -

Not having found any international opposition after the Anschluss and Kristallnacht, he now cynically approved the Hull plan: “I can only hope and expect that the other world, which has such deep sympathy for these criminals, will at least be generous enough to convert this sympathy into practical aid. We, on our part, are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries for all I care, even on luxury ships.”(Hitler is pleased to get rid of foes. Commenting on Hull's Plan He Says Some Opponents of Nazis Deserve to Die”, The New York Times, March 27, 1938).As Goebbels reported in his diary, if “nobody wants the scum!” there should be another way to remove them. In this way, as Ronnie Landau put it, the Evian conference triggered the change of the Nazi policy towards the ‘Final Solution’. (Landau (2006)).</p>\n<p>The Netherlands was only fleetingly involved in efforts to temper this wave of refugees. When 32 countries assembled on president Roosevelt’s initiative in Evian (15), It was on hindsight the last opportunity to save the lives of Europe’s Jews, but the stalemate of the Evian conference only confirmed the complete lack of collective international opposition against the racial politics of Nazi Germany. The United States and Great Britain, facing Hitler’s policy of mass migration, refused to change their restricted immigration policy for ‘undesirable immigrants’, and appealed to Germany’s (soon occupied) neighbouring countries to act as the refugee’s main host countries (like the Netherlands). Eastern European countries, some of them already collaborating with Nazi Germany, refused to take part. The Anglo-Saxon dominated Evian Committee closed their meetings in October 1938 with a memorandum to the German Foreign Office, confirming that none of the assembled nations challenged the right of the German government to deal with its subjects as it liked, as no-one questioned its state sovereignty. (Evian Memorandum, October 1938, quoted in Ronnie S. Landau (2006).) This actually sent the unmistakable permission to all neighbours to close their borders.

The borders were accessible and individuals could stay without a work permit, in the sense that they were not illegal even if their permits had expired. In the 19th century, the primary concern was with the poor and working class, who could become troublesome citizens. Towards 1890, the direct target of this policy were mainly small groups of Hungarian Roma, which for a first time were named “Zigeuners”; this in contrast to the older Sinti nomads with Western-European passports, who were generally allowed to travel. The legislation was tightened only after the First World War, when foreign soldiers and no less than 2 million Belgium refugees entered the country of which many were housed, for a first time, in temporary refugee camps. Travelling without passports would become more difficult in Europe after the democratic success of the introduction of universal suffrage in 1918-19. With the German and Russian revolutions, there was fear for communist agitators to stay in the Netherlands. It strengthened the nationalism of governments now having to take care of citizens wanting to protect their national welfare against the “competition” of others. The 1930s economic crisis further strengthened the wish for protectionism against the competition from foreign German-Jewish businessmen for instance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The possibilities of a Jewish refugee arriving from Germany to the Netherlands after 1933 were  gradually limited. As approximately 40,000 individuals crossed the border from Germany between 1933 and 1940 (more than a quarter of the total number of German-Jewish refugees) they were primarily seen as “economic migrants''. After May 1934, work permits were limited only for jobs which could not be performed by a Dutch citizen, and official policies restricted the possibility of long term accommodation. Permitted to stay were however still refugees who could sustain themselves financially.  Despite the prominence of many members of the Jewish community who had migrated from Eastern Europe because of a growing anti-Semitism, after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933 and his policy of mass migration after Kristallnacht, Dutch newspapers ran articles concluding “refugees are not welcome”</span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It had fostered the rise of the fascist NSB party who in Hitler’s footsteps succeeded in criminalising refugees and creating fears of disturbing the economic and social balance.

Intimidated by their number and needs, the Dutch government closed the borders ‘for the protection of our own people’ but for the many, who had also entered the country illegally, shelter and control were crucial. Most did not work, worked illegally or were simply homeless, so that when refugee camps were established in otherwise remote aread of the Netherlands, they were also thought so as to mitigate risks and the possibilities of integration of the refugees into Dutch society. In the camp, refugees had to work in order to create farmland that would feed the entire camp and although access was not restricted trips outside the camp were limited also due to the lack of financial means. There was consequently hardly any contact with inhabitants nearby. By February 1940Westerbork had 749 refugees by the end of April. On 1st July, 1942 the camp was designated as Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager (police-enforced transit camp for Jews) an stayed like this until the Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (Commander of the Security Police) and the SD (Security Service) took over the administration to be replaced again in January 1943 when the commander of the Security Police (SD) took charge of the Dutch camp. Members from the Jewish community were brought here from across the Netherlands and later transported to Sobibor, Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz. Liberated by Canadian troops, between 1945 and 1948 camp Westerbork served as an internment camp for NSB, SS and other people who were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. It led to a peculiar temporary situation where people suspected of pro-Nazi activity or those who had abused positions of authority lived next to 850 liberated individuals in the camp. The camp was briefly a training base for KNIL soldiers leaving to fight in Indonesia against the revolution of independence. Interestingly, camp Westerbork would see the aftermath of this as on 4th July, 1950, the first Indonesian Dutch repatriates arrived to shelter themselves from retalliations. Around Christmas 1950, the camp had 1 050 inhabitants. They lived in two large barracks near the entrance of the camp. One barrack was for families, the other for single people and older children. The Schattenberg remained isolated and the Moluccan community gradually found work and mostly moved out from the accommodation. The Schattenberg was demolished in 1971 the only remaining visible reference ot the past was the National Monument which had been unveiled on 4th May, 1970.","siteName":"westerbork","country":"Netherlands","latitude":52.916,"longitude":6.606,"inceptionDate":"1939-01-01","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":["emigration","integration","minority","othering"]},{"id":30,"title":"The KNIL Veterans and “national” heritage","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/30","slug":"the-knil-veterans-and----natio","description":"<p>Add a very short description (one sentence)</p>","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-08-12T16:50:38+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T16:51:26+00:00","owner":{"id":26,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/26"},"pages":[{"id":143,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/143","title":"paragraph1","slug":"paragraph1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":30,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/30"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":342,"page_id":143,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 2014, an article in the press was capturing the conflict between two groups of veterans of the Dutch Army.

in the camp show how families were trying to maintain a semblance of normality for children who were growing up far from the homeland. Some integrated fast and went to work in the surrounding cities, like Assen. The camp was a temporary home where children learned the language, and adults were passing the time before hopefully returning to the islands. Initially isolated in the camp in Drenthe, some tried to find work in agriculture or private houses around the camp in order to supplement the little financial support offered by the government. The Dutch government also organized a school in Schattenberg, where children could learn the proper language. Some, with time, went to schools around the former camp.  At the same time, the arrival of the Moluccans in 1951 hightlighted how authority was built on differentiations between identities, based on nationality, religion, ethnicity, class, and gender. by exclusion and inclusion between various, newly performed categories of in- and outsiders, of established and newcomers, and of privileged and disenfranchised, are then part of the biography of this campscape, as similar to many others. From former subjects of the Dutch empire, they were evidently considered rather “second class” citizens, if citizens at

for the military heads of these families, the long wait and the condition of living in isolation proved to be quickly problematic. The memory of the war and of the service, which brought all categories together, did not last for more than a decade. The fact that the government rather tolerated, than cultivate the political cause of the Moluccans and therefore their military status, turned into a conflict. In Westerbork, conflicts started when they were asked to pay contributions as any other refugee and culminated in the forceful intervention in West Kapelle. The footage of the commemoration of the war, in 1956, 11 years after its end, on the former camp site of Westerbork is an opportunity to see, side by side, veterans of the Dutch Army (KL) and veterans of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL).</p>\n<p>The camp had been transformed into a temporary shelter for the Moluccans, a group fighting together with the Dutch armies against the Indonesian independence. And yet, today the role of this community in the war is contested, also partly due to the expectations of Dutch support in securing an independent republic in the Moluccan islands. The commemorations in the camp are now separated, with the former Moluccan KNIL speaking little about the war, and the former KL contesting their role in the war.

Intimidated by their number and needs, the Dutch government closed the borders ‘for the protection of our own people’ but for the many, who had also entered the country illegally, shelter and control were crucial. Most did not work, worked illegally or were simply homeless, so that when refugee camps were established in otherwise remote aread of the Netherlands, they were also thought so as to mitigate risks and the possibilities of integration of the refugees into Dutch society. In the camp, refugees had to work in order to create farmland that would feed the entire camp and although access was not restricted trips outside the camp were limited also due to the lack of financial means. There was consequently hardly any contact with inhabitants nearby. By February 1940Westerbork had 749 refugees by the end of April. On 1st July, 1942 the camp was designated as Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager (police-enforced transit camp for Jews) an stayed like this until the Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (Commander of the Security Police) and the SD (Security Service) took over the administration to be replaced again in January 1943 when the commander of the Security Police (SD) took charge of the Dutch camp. Members from the Jewish community were brought here from across the Netherlands and later transported to Sobibor, Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz. Liberated by Canadian troops, between 1945 and 1948 camp Westerbork served as an internment camp for NSB, SS and other people who were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. It led to a peculiar temporary situation where people suspected of pro-Nazi activity or those who had abused positions of authority lived next to 850 liberated individuals in the camp. The camp was briefly a training base for KNIL soldiers leaving to fight in Indonesia against the revolution of independence. Interestingly, camp Westerbork would see the aftermath of this as on 4th July, 1950, the first Indonesian Dutch repatriates arrived to shelter themselves from retalliations. Around Christmas 1950, the camp had 1 050 inhabitants. They lived in two large barracks near the entrance of the camp. One barrack was for families, the other for single people and older children. The Schattenberg remained isolated and the Moluccan community gradually found work and mostly moved out from the accommodation. The Schattenberg was demolished in 1971 the only remaining visible reference ot the past was the National Monument which had been unveiled on 4th May, 1970.","siteName":"westerbork","country":"Netherlands","latitude":52.916,"longitude":6.606,"inceptionDate":"1939-01-01","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":[]},{"id":31,"title":"The postcolonial “blankspot” and military memory","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/31","slug":"the-postcolonial----blankspot-","description":"","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-08-12T17:29:08+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T17:29:08+00:00","owner":{"id":26,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/26"},"pages":[{"id":150,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/150","title":"paragraph1","slug":"paragraph1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":31,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/31"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":349,"page_id":150,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 2018, the final ruling in a long trial against the Dutch government rules the two soldiers in the Dutch Army and implicitly the state did not make use of “extraordinary means of violence” against the Moluccan group. The trial was the latest legal reaction to the the military intervention of the government in 1977, when a group of young Moluccans hijacked a train between Assen and Groningen. It was the fourth such type of action demanding the the support of the government for the independent republic of Moluccan Islands. It turned however into a divisive political debate and memorial concern when two of the hostages were killed. The intervention of the Dutch troops resulted in the death of six of the hijackers. The debate in the recent trial was whether the intervention en force had indeed been necessary and whether the victims were not an unncessary consequence of the use of force. It was a tense moment, which was also amply speculated by the fact that Parliamentary elections were being held at the time. The prime-minister was among the first on site and the intervention was covered live.

in 1939 for the initial wave of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany, in particular after the Kristallnach in 1938, Kamp Westerbork was to solve the problem of accommodating the wave of around 10000 refugees crossing the Dutch border. Intimidated by their number and needs, the Dutch government closed the borders ‘for the protection of our own people’ but for the many, who had also entered the country illegally, shelter and control were crucial. Most did not work, worked illegally or were simply homeless, so that when refugee camps were established in otherwise remote aread of the Netherlands, they were also thought so as to mitigate risks and the possibilities of integration of the refugees into Dutch society. In the camp, refugees had to work in order to create farmland that would feed the entire camp and although access was not restricted trips outside the camp were limited also due to the lack of financial means. There was consequently hardly any contact with inhabitants nearby. By February 1940Westerbork had 749 refugees by the end of April. On 1st July, 1942 the camp was designated as Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager (police-enforced transit camp for Jews) an stayed like this until the Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (Commander of the Security Police) and the SD (Security Service) took over the administration to be replaced again in January 1943 when the commander of the Security Police (SD) took charge of the Dutch camp. Members from the Jewish community were brought here from across the Netherlands and later transported to Sobibor, Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz. Liberated by Canadian troops, between 1945 and 1948 camp Westerbork served as an internment camp for NSB, SS and other people who were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. It led to a peculiar temporary situation where people suspected of pro-Nazi activity or those who had abused positions of authority lived next to 850 liberated individuals in the camp. The camp was briefly a training base for KNIL soldiers leaving to fight in Indonesia against the revolution of independence. Interestingly, camp Westerbork would see the aftermath of this as on 4th July, 1950, the first Indonesian Dutch repatriates arrived to shelter themselves from retalliations. Around Christmas 1950, the camp had 1 050 inhabitants. They lived in two large barracks near the entrance of the camp. One barrack was for families, the other for single people and older children. The Schattenberg remained isolated and the Moluccan community gradually found work and mostly moved out from the accommodation. The Schattenberg was demolished in 1971 the only remaining visible reference ot the past was the National Monument which had been unveiled on 4th May, 1970.","siteName":"westerbork","country":"Netherlands","latitude":52.916,"longitude":6.606,"inceptionDate":"1939-01-01","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":[]},{"id":32,"title":"Representing perpetrators through heritage","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/32","slug":"representing-perpetrators-thro","description":"","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-08-12T17:48:12+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T17:49:06+00:00","owner":{"id":26,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/26"},"pages":[{"id":156,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/156","title":"paragraph1","slug":"paragraph1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":32,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/32"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":355,"page_id":156,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 2015, the Dutch curator Erik Schilp in the daily Dutch De Volkskrant was calling the new glass case that the Westerbork memorial placed over the Commander House “expensive and unnecessary”. He argued that it is not in itself representative of the history of the camp and should only distract visitors from its main story about the victims of the Holocaust as symbolised by Ralph Prince’s National Monument and the monument of the 102.000 stones. The memorial argued, however, that these were designed as memorials, whereas the house is one of the few remaining authentic remnants of the disappeared camp. It was developed from the start as an integral part of the 1939 plan of the Central Refugee Camp. After the camp turned into a transit camp for Dutch Jews in 1942, the director’s home became the seat of the Nazi-German camp commander Albert Gemmeker and his secretary and mistress Elisabeth Hassler. They both played an important role in the many transmitted memories of inmates, whose experience and fate in (and after) the camp were decided from this perpetrator space. Slanted to the main road of the camp, which in 1942 turned into a railway platform, the commander had a panoptic view on the railway platform. From the balcony of his office on the first floor he could monitor the arriving trains from Amsterdam and the Nazi-German concentrations camps Vught and Amersfoort, and the departing trains to the eastern concentration and extermination camps Auschwitz, Sobibor, Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2111,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2111","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:30:22+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:30:22+00:00","item_type":"hyperlink","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2111","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":156,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/156","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"url":"https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/megavitrine-westerbork-is-duur-en-onnodig~bc7df773/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F","title":"The

Initially sidelined in a few important and mediatized cases (like the trial in Nuremberg, the Auschwitz trial, the Eichmann trial), that played in fact in the anti-fascist narrative of memory which helped both the Eastern European communism and the Western European social democracy to stabilize (Rethinking Antifascism: History, Memory and Politics, 1922 to the Present, 2016), with the rise of the memory of the Holocaust by the 1970s the discussion was almost exclusively focused on the victims (Levy, Szaider 2010).</p>\n<p>Perspectives on the perpetrators have changed dramatically over the decades that have passed:Yet, the fierce debates surrounding the publication of Jonathan Littell’s novel Les Bienveillantes in 2006, a fictional memoir of an SS-officer, a number of other cultural productions returned the gaze to the perpetrator. At times, this angle retraced the complex motivations and a gray type of historical writing which had been popular earlier, but it also asked questions about what a history exclusively told through victimhood constructs. It exposed a central tension in public and academic conceptions of witnessing and the Holocaust: letting the victim speak only about its own trauma or making the victim be a warden of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocides. Paradoxically, the interest in the perpetrators emerged with a growing historiography which shows the pitfalls of the generalization of victimhood, the disturbing vindication of said condition on behalf of those responsible, the ever-more abundant participation of ordinary perpetrators in massacres or, on occasions, the fragile border that separates victim and aggressor.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2130,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2130","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:39:20+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:39:20+00:00","item_type":"reference","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2130","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":159,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/159","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Politics of Regret","author":"Olick Jeffrey ","titleOfBookOrArticle":"Politics of Regret","publicationYear":"2007","publisher":"Routledge","cityOfPublication":"London New York","files":[]}}},{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2131,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2131","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:39:21+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:39:21+00:00","item_type":"reference","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2131","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":159,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/159","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Rethinking Antifascism: History, Memory and Politics, 1922 to the Present","titleOfBookOrArticle":"Rethinking Antifascism: History, Memory and Politics, 1922 to the Present","publisher":"Berghahn Books","editor":"Hugo García, Mercedes Yusta, Xavier Tabet, and Cristina Clímaco","files":[]}}},{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2132,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2132","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:39:21+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:39:21+00:00","item_type":"reference","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2132","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":159,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/159","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Human Rights and Memory","author":"Levy, Daniel;  Szaider, Natan ","titleOfBookOrArticle":"Human Rights and Memory","publicationYear":"2010","files":[]}}},{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2112,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2112","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:30:23+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:30:23+00:00","item_type":"hyperlink","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2112","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":159,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/159","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"url":"https://www.groene.nl/artikel/een-man-van-grote-woorden","title":"A man of big words, by Jacq Vogelaar","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":160,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/160","title":"paragraph5","slug":"paragraph5","order":6,"exhibit":{"id":32,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/32"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":359,"page_id":160,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>The heritage of the perpetrator however inevitably maintains alive a memory of injustice, rather than reconciliation, of half said truths or of justice attempts which were only pure expressions of the time, lin the same vein as the “forced confrontations” had been at the end of the war for denazification. Indeed, at the end of the war, the polics of “dead bodied” was an instrument of memory as much as of education, of sorts. But this connection has been easy ever since, primariy because it changed the idea that heritage is necessarily triumphant or glorious. If heritage is always about identity, than inscribing the perpetrator into heritage shows a “negative” side of this identity, a lack or a pitfall. Often, as in the case of other trials at the end of the war, for instance Hanns Albin Rauter, they were discussed and positioned as an external element to the “nation” and the country. The war in this case, and the biography of Gemmeker inscripts a perpetrator who, a foreigner and a product of an “exceptionalist” German regime, speaks little about the local context. Were we indeed to zoom out of the history of the house and its meaning as heritage of perpetratorship, this angle would make it evocative of the type of power dynamics, abuse and subjectification happening equally during the refugee during the war, the house is also a good reminder of how power works through fragmenting and compartmentalized rulers and powerless, of “perpetrators” and “victims”. During the refugee period, its physical existence designated who was an inmate and who held authority. These connotations reinforced the oppositions which makes a camp: between “citizens” and “strangers”, “natives” and “migrants”.

has been an ample historical attention on the perpetrators in the Netherlands. this inchoate debate, there have been attempts to discuss and understand for instance the role and the motivation of Albert Konrad Gemmeker, the last commander of Westerbork . Described as a “gentleman”, his character was probed extensively after the war, more so than his deeds. The trial after the war and the short sentence were however an accurate map of the debates on what a memory of perpetratorship should serve: reconstruction, localizing the perpetrator and moving on, rather than dwelling on the past. Identifying the perpetrator as “German” was a side of the debate, fuelling in fact much of the selectivity of the history ever since. Their histories are infinitely more complex. For instance, the first commander of Westerbork, Erich Deppner, working in the Sicherheitspolizei in the Hague, has all chances of being held accountable after the war as evidence against him was mounting. The direct adjuct of Hanns Albin Rauter, in Camp Amersfoort, Deppner was responsble for mass shootings and murders of hundreds of Russian and German war prisoners. Testimonies from Westerbork speak about a ruthless person who coordinated the first transports. For his “achievements” he was transferred as commander in Kamp Vught, also in the Netherlands,where he was responsble, again, for at least 500 executions and a ruthless regime of the facility. Towards the end of the war, Deppner was transferred again to Germany and despite the waves of trials immediately after the war and a new momentum of transitional justice which swept Germany at the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, Deppner never appeared in a court of law. In 1964, the German authorities re-opened the case against AK Gemmeker, who suggests in an interview at the time that he is no way to be held responsible, and the he did not know what the transports and the destinations of these were. Despite the large uproar also in the Netherlands, he was sentenced to only two years of prison. Deppner, who by that time had ascended from the ranks of the Organization Gehlen to the German BND (the West German Secret Service) was never even questioned.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":1930,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/1930","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:17:19+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T08:17:19+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=1930","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"count":2,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages?item=1930","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Dining

Intimidated by their number and needs, the Dutch government closed the borders ‘for the protection of our own people’ but for the many, who had also entered the country illegally, shelter and control were crucial. Most did not work, worked illegally or were simply homeless, so that when refugee camps were established in otherwise remote aread of the Netherlands, they were also thought so as to mitigate risks and the possibilities of integration of the refugees into Dutch society. In the camp, refugees had to work in order to create farmland that would feed the entire camp and although access was not restricted trips outside the camp were limited also due to the lack of financial means. There was consequently hardly any contact with inhabitants nearby. By February 1940Westerbork had 749 refugees by the end of April. On 1st July, 1942 the camp was designated as Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager (police-enforced transit camp for Jews) an stayed like this until the Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (Commander of the Security Police) and the SD (Security Service) took over the administration to be replaced again in January 1943 when the commander of the Security Police (SD) took charge of the Dutch camp. Members from the Jewish community were brought here from across the Netherlands and later transported to Sobibor, Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz. Liberated by Canadian troops, between 1945 and 1948 camp Westerbork served as an internment camp for NSB, SS and other people who were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. It led to a peculiar temporary situation where people suspected of pro-Nazi activity or those who had abused positions of authority lived next to 850 liberated individuals in the camp. The camp was briefly a training base for KNIL soldiers leaving to fight in Indonesia against the revolution of independence. Interestingly, camp Westerbork would see the aftermath of this as on 4th July, 1950, the first Indonesian Dutch repatriates arrived to shelter themselves from retalliations. Around Christmas 1950, the camp had 1 050 inhabitants. They lived in two large barracks near the entrance of the camp. One barrack was for families, the other for single people and older children. The Schattenberg remained isolated and the Moluccan community gradually found work and mostly moved out from the accommodation. The Schattenberg was demolished in 1971 the only remaining visible reference ot the past was the National Monument which had been unveiled on 4th May, 1970.","siteName":"westerbork","country":"Netherlands","latitude":52.916,"longitude":6.606,"inceptionDate":"1939-01-01","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":[]},{"id":33,"title":"The trace of the political Left","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/33","slug":"the-trace-of-the-political-lef","description":"<p>One sentence intro</p>","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-08-12T18:36:51+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T18:36:51+00:00","owner":{"id":26,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/26"},"pages":[{"id":163,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/163","title":"paragraph1","slug":"paragraph1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":33,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/33"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":362,"page_id":163,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 2010, historian Timothy Snyder published an opinion piece in the Guardian under the title “the Reich’s forgotten atrocity”, rightfully pointing to the paradoxical extent to which Russian prisoners of war and war damages during operation Barbarossa, are forgotten.

Communists were pursued as a threat to the stability of the country and interned in the increasing number of facilities: Fort Honswijk, for instance, which was also the focus was of a widespread protest in 1935 against the policy by the Rode Hulp (Red Support), next to Nieuwersluis, Bergen op Zoom, Breda, Maastricht, Tilburg and Vlissingen. The issue was so stringent for the government that also those who returned from fighting in the civil war in Spain, communists and social democrats alike, were imprisoned in Nieuwersluis, in Utrecht.</p>\n<p>Even if such camps closed, many among those considered dangerous were still imprisoned, for instance in regular prisons.

This fear of social disruption endured and was aggravated by the February 1941 strike of factory workers after the first round-up of the Jewish Community in Amsterdam. Catalyzed by the Dutch Communist Party, it led to German retaliations and massive deportations of participants to Germany as political prisoners.</p>","order":1,"attachments":[{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2036,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2036","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T08:23:27+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T12:34:58+00:00","item_type":"resource","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":1,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2036","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":168,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/168","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"title":"Better SS than communist","startDate":"Article analyzing the hardshipsof the fighters returning from the International Brigades in Spain and their memory","latitude":2016,"provenance":"Volksrant","files":[{"id":788,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/788","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.pdf","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-12T12:34:56+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T12:34:58+00:00","filename":"a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.pdf","authentication":"6512ba75f2b2a563adf643d4c005f63d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"SpainFighers.pdf","size":382778,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.4","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2036,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2036","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]}},"file":{"id":788,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files/788","file_urls":{"original":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/original/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.pdf","fullsize":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/fullsize/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg","thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/thumbnails/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/files/square_thumbnails/a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.jpg"},"added":"2019-08-12T12:34:56+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T12:34:58+00:00","filename":"a4c280748e6483817d154e04e5146b22.pdf","authentication":"6512ba75f2b2a563adf643d4c005f63d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"application/pdf","order":null,"original_filename":"SpainFighers.pdf","size":382778,"stored":true,"type_os":"PDF document, version 1.4","metadata":{"mime_type":"application/pdf"},"item":{"id":2036,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2036","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}},{"caption":null,"item":{"id":2107,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/items/2107","public":false,"featured":false,"added":"2019-08-09T09:30:20+00:00","modified":"2019-08-09T09:30:20+00:00","item_type":"hyperlink","collection":null,"owner":{"id":25,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/25","resource":"users"},"files":{"count":0,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/files?item=2107","resource":"files"},"tags":[],"extended_resources":{"exhibit_pages":{"id":168,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/168","resource":"exhibit_pages"}},"data":{"url":"http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/rapportencentraleinlichtingendienst/data/IndexResultaten/IndexPersoon?reconstructieid=1380&persoon=ja&query_start=1","title":"List and documentation of Spanish fighters in the Netherlands, Huygens Institute for Dutch History","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":169,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/169","title":"paragraph7","slug":"paragraph7","order":8,"exhibit":{"id":33,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/33"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":368,"page_id":169,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>Werner Sterzenbach, an early communist in Deutsch-jϋdischer Wanderbund 'Kameraden' who fled Germany in 1933 and joined in Dutch communist circles and later the resistance.

The communist underground, made out of the many illegals who had either escaped from the prisons or were actively released through various pressures against the politics of the government.</p>\n<p>These individuals made the first efforts to document the occupation, to gather incriminatory material presumably useful at the end. Werner Sterzenbach himself was one of the first people to be released, shortly after May 1945, a plea to reckon with perpetrators and collaborators.

Intimidated by their number and needs, the Dutch government closed the borders ‘for the protection of our own people’ but for the many, who had also entered the country illegally, shelter and control were crucial. Most did not work, worked illegally or were simply homeless, so that when refugee camps were established in otherwise remote aread of the Netherlands, they were also thought so as to mitigate risks and the possibilities of integration of the refugees into Dutch society. In the camp, refugees had to work in order to create farmland that would feed the entire camp and although access was not restricted trips outside the camp were limited also due to the lack of financial means. There was consequently hardly any contact with inhabitants nearby. By February 1940Westerbork had 749 refugees by the end of April. On 1st July, 1942 the camp was designated as Polizeiliches Judendurchgangslager (police-enforced transit camp for Jews) an stayed like this until the Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (Commander of the Security Police) and the SD (Security Service) took over the administration to be replaced again in January 1943 when the commander of the Security Police (SD) took charge of the Dutch camp. Members from the Jewish community were brought here from across the Netherlands and later transported to Sobibor, Bergen Belsen, Auschwitz. Liberated by Canadian troops, between 1945 and 1948 camp Westerbork served as an internment camp for NSB, SS and other people who were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis. It led to a peculiar temporary situation where people suspected of pro-Nazi activity or those who had abused positions of authority lived next to 850 liberated individuals in the camp. The camp was briefly a training base for KNIL soldiers leaving to fight in Indonesia against the revolution of independence. Interestingly, camp Westerbork would see the aftermath of this as on 4th July, 1950, the first Indonesian Dutch repatriates arrived to shelter themselves from retalliations. Around Christmas 1950, the camp had 1 050 inhabitants. They lived in two large barracks near the entrance of the camp. One barrack was for families, the other for single people and older children. The Schattenberg remained isolated and the Moluccan community gradually found work and mostly moved out from the accommodation. The Schattenberg was demolished in 1971 the only remaining visible reference ot the past was the National Monument which had been unveiled on 4th May, 1970.","siteName":"westerbork","country":"Netherlands","latitude":52.916,"longitude":6.606,"inceptionDate":"1939-01-01","files":[]}}}]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":[]},{"id":34,"title":"Dynamics of the Jewish memory of resistance around Westerbork","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/34","slug":"dynamics-of-the-jewish-memory-","description":"","credits":"","featured":false,"public":false,"added":"2019-08-12T18:55:46+00:00","modified":"2019-08-12T18:55:46+00:00","owner":{"id":26,"resource":"users","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/users/26"},"pages":[{"id":173,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/173","title":"paragraph1","slug":"paragraph1","order":2,"exhibit":{"id":34,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/34"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":372,"page_id":173,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p>In 1979, the report on the wartime activities of Friedrich Weinreb issued by RIOD in Amsterdam was atypical.

Post-war claims that Jews had heroically resisted the Nazis on a large scale, and that even if not every Jew had engaged the enemy in direct combat, had been prevalent in the angle that also emphasized the support of the non-Jewish community. Indeed, the Jewish debate was at least problematic for the myth of the resistance, something evident also during the unveiling of the monument itself, when the mayor of Amsterdam at the time referenced “pride, but also shame”.

In the 1960s, Loe de Jong dealt with the persecution of Jews in his television series The Occupation, a widely popular show and an important memory device of the age. Interestingly, a case like Weinreb, who had been prosecuted in 1948 for his contribution to the deportation but served virtually no time in prison due to the amnesty for Queen Wilhemina’s jubileum, was a far too controversial case to feature at all in the series. Jacques Presser, on the other hand, dedicated consistent passages to his character in the canonical book <em>Ondergang: De vervolging en verdelging van het Nederlandse Jodendom 1940-1945</em> primarily because of the side of the type of history he portrayed, that of compromise, rather than opposition. He was a side of a deeply contested and debated length and seriousness of the Jewish resistance and complicity.

The trial effectively terminated any official functions they might hold in the Jewish community. In 1956, the memoires of David Cohen, leader of the Jewish Council brought to the fore controversial questions about the organization. Weinreb was a similar disputed case, and was tried in 1948 but freed after 6 months. His case, in particular, contributed in a deeply divisive debate about the Jewish “resistance” which started with the case around the directors of the Jewish Council early after the war. Pardoned, however, his story in fact provided an alternative narrative to the other trials. It equally emerged in a context focused almost exclusively on an affirmative memory. Indeed, the context of collaborators was more complicated after the war.

There were individuals actions that many took, from helping people in hiding, distributing illegal newspapers or blowing up railway lines. So were the propaganda leaflets which insisted on larger actions.

There was a sporadic mobilization of former members of the military but their influence was limited. The communist resistance was less developed as in neighbouring countries, primarily due to a rather weak presence on the political local spectrum.</p>\n<p>In 1940, the small Communist party went into hiding, where Paul de Groot, the leader, initiated the publication of de Waarheid (the Truth). By 1941, there was a strong network of support which initiated the Februaristaking (walks out in Amsterdam and Zaandam) of workers protesting against the treatment of the Jewish community. Landelijke Organisatie (LO) was set up with the direct purpose of hiding those to be deported. For the fake papers, documents there was a continous “annoyance” of German authorities but the actions were considered to be kept under control by the SS. Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten , the local traces of the army decided often against guerilla actions. It was in this contrast that the memory of the resistance emerged after the war as a crucial binding force. Its character was predominanly military and .

It was the case of Bep Turksma, a young Jewish woman who managed to escape from Westerbork in 1942, who had been on one of the lists of Weinreb and who he argued had reported him to the SD, presumably affecting the chances of his plans. Turksma initiated a legal case against the publication of Collaboration and Resistance and filed two criminal complaints against Weinreb, Rubinstein for defamation. Although the RIOD report would establish a decade later that her claims were true, the judge at the time decided that she could not prove her claims. The verdict occassioned further campaigning in Vrij Nederland against Turksma.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the passages about her were erased in the edition of 1971 of his bioraphy.

fact, although the debate itself questioned the grounds of many memorial images and history perspectives, it is telling that as the debate about the publication came to question the guilt possibly attributed to Weinreb, there were many more voices not often questioned the verdict in the trial of Weinreb, which had been one of the most followed at the time. Fred Polak asked Minister of Justice Ivo Samkalden on 25 May 1965 whether this was not seen in Presser's study as a reason to revise the judgment. Samkalden answered in the negative: Presser might have a different opinion on the criminal case against Weinreb, but he had not provided any new information. A few legal scholars shared Samkalden's sobering judgment: Presser's argument was emotional and made no sense legally; Weinreb was correctly sentenced in 1948. The historian M.C.

He reminded public opinion not of an individual story of survival, but of the uncomfortable and harrowing presence that images of war have been ever since. In April 1945, he fell under the photographic gaze of British photojournalist George Rodger, who was, as most at the time, looking to convey what seemed to be all of a sudden the hidden tragedies of the Nazi camp system. Maandag, an eight-year-old boy, was, in that famous picture, looking rather confused in the opposite direction of a road lined with corpses.(1) For a long time, Maandag was almost synonymous to an image of innocence lost, of many generations having to deal and live with the reality of the war as the documentary evidence, those who had survived and were telling their stories and demanding people not to turn a blind eye were increasing. Roger’s very career testified to these issues: he set up Magnum, together with Robert Capa, another man shaped by war, and yet he refused to work in conflict zones, conflicted about the ethics of this documentation. Paradoxically, two years after Maandag’s death, in 2019, when the same picture was used in an exhibition in Amsterdam, it became evident that Maandag’s picture in Life magazine in 1945 had been indeed difficult for the American and worldwide public. The dead, arguably those who died because of the deadly typhus epidemics during the last days of the camp and in the first weeks after liberation, had been airbrushed.

The Allied photography during the war was a strong presence in press and footage and newsreel on the exploits on the front, from newsreel to news. The mobilization of this type of images during the war was to present the war as a heroic exploit against the Nazis but also a motivation of the extensive mobilization of effort. The Soviet press at the time was equally covering the extensive “antifascist” campaign, as perhaps best illustrates the famous “Raising a Flag over the Reichstag” by Yevgeny Khaldei (3). The heroism of war was synonymous, in this context, with the documentation and the unravelling of the power to deceive of the defeated enemies.</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":194,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/194","title":"paragraph 4","slug":"paragraph-4","order":4,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":394,"page_id":194,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Whether that was indeed the situation during the war is a more nuanced question. The camps, in particular, were meant to be hidden, the very notion of camp implies an isolation and disenfranchisement of the individual, but they were, by no means, really invisible. Reports from the camp circulated through Europe all through the 5 years. The Polish Jan Karksi spoke about the inferno in occupied Poland as soon as 1940 as a matter of international affairs with the British, French and Soviet governments. The Vrba Wetzel report with testimonies smuggled out of Auschwitz kept headlines in 1943 all through Europe. The suffering of the Jews in camps was known.</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":195,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/195","title":"paragraph 5","slug":"paragraph-5","order":5,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":395,"page_id":195,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But Allied phototography was equally important to the situation post-war. The “forced confrontations” imposed by the Allies to members of the communities around dictated, of sorts, the image and the use of images of atrocity, of death and the violent deaths suffered in the war. Images of these moments were perhaps as powerful as the images of bodies themselves.(6)</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":196,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/196","title":"paragraph 6","slug":"paragraph-6","order":6,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":396,"page_id":196,"layout":"file-text","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But the case of Roger’s retouching suggests however that images of atrocity have been  difficult to debate even as the war was going on or ending. This debate, about the ethics of responsibility, whether this owes primarily to the dignity of the victim, or on the contrary, to the ethics of social knowledge about war and conflict in general continues today. The extent to which such images were to the displayed is a constant question for memorials and museums, for instance: does too much exposure desensitize the viewer? Does the viewer engage in a voyeuristic gesture, inevitably, when in contact with such images and hence diminish both their effect and undercut the very purpose of their purpose for the victim?</span></p>","order":1,"attachments":[]}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":190,"url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibit_pages/190","title":"site","slug":"site","order":0,"exhibit":{"id":40,"resource":"exhibits","url":"http://www.dbportal.ic-access.specs-lab.com/api/exhibits/40"},"parent":null,"page_blocks":[{"id":390,"page_id":190,"layout":"file","options":{"file-position":"left","file-size":"fullsize","captions-position":"center"},"text":null,"order":2,"attachments":[]}],"extended_resources":[]}],"extended_resources":[],"tags":[]}]
